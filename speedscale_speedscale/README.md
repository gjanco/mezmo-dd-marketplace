# Speedscale

## Overview
Many businesses struggle to discover problems with their cloud services before they impact customers. For developers, writing tests is manual and time-intensive. Speedscale helps Kubernetes engineering and DevOps teams gain confidence in how new code will perform in real-world scenarios. Speedscale can collect and replay API traffic, simulate load or chaos, and measure latency, throughput, saturation, and errors before the code is released. Speedscale Traffic Replay is an alternative to legacy testing approaches which take days or weeks to run and do not scale well for modern architectures.

To publish traffic replay results from Speedscale into Datadog, install the [Speedscale Integration][1]. This integration lets you combine your observability data from Datadog with the results of a particular Speedscale replay to investigate the root cause of poor performance.

## Setup
If you have just purchased Speedscale, a representative will reach out to you shortly to set up your environment and guide you through your deployment.

To start sharing data between Datadog and Speedscale, set up the [Speedscale Integration][1].

## Uninstallation

First, cancel your subscription in Plan & Pricing. Speedscale will then reach out to confirm and disconnect your account.
