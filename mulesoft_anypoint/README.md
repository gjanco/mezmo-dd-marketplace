# Datadog Mule速 Integration

## Overview

The Datadog Mule速 Integration is an Agent-based integration that collects metrics from MuleSoft products and uploads them into Datadog. 

![Datadog Mule速 Integration Bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/marketplace/master/mulesoft_anypoint/images/dmi_bundle.png)

You can use these metrics to take advantage of the out-of-the-box dashboards and monitors or you can create your own visualizations.

### **The observability you need for your Mule applications**

#### Operations (_Infrastructure, APIs, Alerts and Resource Allocation Dashboards_) 

- Monitor the health of your Mule servers, applications, APIs, and other IT infrastructure 
- Receive and visualize alerts about your Mule infrastructure 
- Gain insights about your Anypoint Platform resources allocation of your organization

#### Development (_Optimization Dashboard_) 

- Quickly identify memory, CPU, and network issues in your Mule applications 
- Find bottlenecks in your Mule applications to optimize performance 
- Instrument your Mule applications with our Datadog Connector for Mule 4 for troubleshooting purposes

#### Executive (_Cost-optimization and Downtime Dashboard_) 

- Analyze and forecast your ROI based on used and unused resources 
- Get visibility of the system uptime of your Mule investment

#### Metrics are collected from the following MuleSoft products: 

- Mule runtime for both CloudHub and on-premise standalone servers 
- Anypoint API Manager and API Analytics
- Anypoint Exchange 
- Anypoint Access Management 
- Object Store v2 

### **Instrument your Mule applications with our Datadog Mule 4 Connector**

![Datadog Connector for Mule 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/marketplace/master/mulesoft_anypoint/images/dmi_mule_connector.png)

Use the Datadog Connector for Mule 4 with Datadog APM tracing to gain visibility using the out-of-the-box performance dashboards.

Measure the performance of the operations in your flows as granular as needed using spans.

Also, correlate the logs generated within a transaction in a single trace to narrow down any performance optimization or troubleshooting scope.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 2.7+ (preferably Python 3.8)
2. pip package installer
3. Java 8+

### Installation

To install the mulesoft_anypoint check on your host:

1. [Download and install the Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/overview).
2. Run `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent integration install --third-party datadog-mulesoft-anypoint==1.2.0`
  
### Configuration

1. Edit the `mulesoft_anypoint.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your mulesoft_anypoint performance data. On Linux systems, ensure the owner of the `conf.yaml` file is `dd-agent`. On OS X systems, ensure the owner of the `conf.yaml` file is the system user running the agent. See the [sample mulesoft_anypoint.d/conf.yaml][3] for all available configuration options.
2. [Restart the Agent][4].

#### Sample configuration

The Datadog Mule速 Integration collects metrics from many different MuleSoft products. Configure the `mulesoft_anypoint.d/conf.yaml` file with the following instances to collect metrics from Mule runtimes, CloudHub, Anypoint Runtime Manager, Access Management and Object Store v2.

```yaml
