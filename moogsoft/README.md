## Overview

Easily integrate Datadog and Moogsoft for combined AI monitoring and observability power!  Whether you are completely digital or have legacy applications, or a hybrid of both, this solution reduces the alert noise and improves operational efficiency across teams and IT Operations.

Moogsoft provides an advanced self-servicing AI-driven observability platform that allows software engineers, developers, and operations to instantly see everything, know what's wrong, and fix things faster.

Moogsoft delivers an enterprise-class, cloud-native platform that empowers customers to drive adoption at their own pace at a much lower cost.

### Observe

Improve service delivery quality. We only elevate critical situations, so you and your team can move swiftly, stay focused, and resolve incidents before they cause outages.

### Monitor

Watch alert volumes go down and see productivity go up. We help eliminate event fatigue with a consolidated monitoring panel and by correlating similar events to significantly minimize actionable alerts.

### Collaborate

See everything in one view. We aggregate all of your apps, services, and infrastructure alerts to a single console for increased agility, fewer alerts, and faster resolution times.

### Moogsoft Data Flow

Data flows through Moogsoft gaining context and reducing noise at each step. Metrics become events, events become stateful alerts, and alerts are correlated into incidents.
