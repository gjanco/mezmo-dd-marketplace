# Datadog Reporter

## Overview

[![Reporter Introduction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/marketplace/master/reporter/images/video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK5cGDUr1CA)

Datadog Reporter allows you to schedule reports and email them out on a set interval. You can pick any of your existing dashboards, add the URL to the reporter web application, and set the mailing interval to send it out. The report will be emailed to your users as an attachment that they can open to view.  There is currently no limit to the number of reports you can generate and send.

This integration will setup a new dashboard in your Datadog instance called **Datadog Reporter**.  The application can be accessed directly by going to the dashboard and creating a new user from that iFrame.  *Your Datadog account will NOT work in the DD Reporter application.  You must register a seperate account*
