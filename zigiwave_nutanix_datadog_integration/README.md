# Nutanix Integration


## Overview

ZigiOps is the most flexible, no-code integration platform. The ZigiOps product
helps your businesses identify, report, and resolve issues in your IT 
environments faster than ever. Integrate ZigiOps into your software ecosystem to connect to popular enterprise 
software tools for ITSM, ITOM, and DevOps: Jira, ServiceNow, VMware 
vROps, Micro Focus Ops Bridge, BMC, Cherwell, Splunk, and more.

### Datadog – Nutanix with ZigiOps

With the ZigiWave Datadog - Nutanix integration, you can extract alerts from Nutanix and populate them in Datadog. ZigiOps syncs all fields such as the incident summary, detection method, severity, status, and more.

### Incidents

ZigiOps offers fully customizable integration templates for the Datadog – Nutanix integration, including a template that maps Nutanix alerts to Datadog incidents. Users can modify data mappings and filters provided by the templates to make them fit with their use case. If your use case doesn’t fit within the template, you can also create an integration from scratch. Integration consultants will guide you along the way.

## Setup

A member of the ZigiWave team will be in touch with you via email to provide access to the ZigiOps environment and set up your 14-day free trial. After the trial expires, they will get in touch again to see if you would like to subscribe and continue using ZigiOps. Trials are subject to 30-day extension in case users need more time to test ZigiOps.

**Step 1**

For the on-prem version of the tool, the first step of the integration process is to install ZigiOps. For the cloud version, the process starts by simply logging in from the UI. Either way, it only takes a few clicks.
After logging into ZigiOps, you are taken to the Dashboard. It provides valuable information regarding the health and status of your integrations, as well as other important information such as licenses, troubleshooting options, and more.  


**Step 2**

Open the menu and choose the systems you'd like to connect. For this integration, select Datadog and Nutanix. You will connect to Datadog using your instance URLs and API keys. The connection to Nutanix is done with your instance URL, admin, and password. Once completed, ZigiOps will check if the connection was successful.

**Step 3**

Once the connection to your systems is verified, go to the “Configurator” menu and choose a ready-to-use integration template to load. Our templates are fully customizable and all fields can be configured as you'd like to synchronize the two systems. You can also start an integration from scratch - in this case, our integration consultants will guide you through the configuration from start to finish.

**Step 4**

Once you load an integration template or start an integration from scratch, you will need to define the target system and destination system for the integration. Once that's complete, the following actions must be configured: data collection, filtering, conditions, and field mappings. 

Once completed, save the integration and it will start syncing data between Datadog and Nutanix. If you need help with customizations or setting up your integrations, our consultants can guide you.
