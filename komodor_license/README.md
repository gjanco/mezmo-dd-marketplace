# Komodor - Kubernetes Troubleshooting Platform

## Overview

Komodor tracks changes across your entire K8s stack, analyzes their ripple effects, and provides you with the context you need to troubleshoot efficiently and independently. Komodor gives you insight into your Kubernetes deployments on a timeline with relevant information such as what changed, what code was pushed, and who pushed it. You can also view data from Git, config maps, your infrastructure, alerting, and other tools such as Datadog, in one centralized and easy-to-understand display. 

This offering in the Datadog Marketplace provides access to the Komodor platform. If you are already a Komodor customer and need to connect your instance to Datadog, [set up the integration][1].

## Setup

If you have just purchased Komodor, a representative will reach out to you shortly to set up your environment and guide you through your deployment.
