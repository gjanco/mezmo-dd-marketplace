## Overview

### What is Skykit

Skykit is a leading digital signage and workplace experience solution provider. We offer a comprehensive content management system that allows you to bring your real-time Datadog dashboards to your TVs, screens, or digital displays.

### Connecting Datadog Dashboards to Skykit

When connected to Skykit’s CMS, the webview tool connects your Datadog dashboards to your screens. Skykit also offers secure authentication through [Dashboard Connections](https://www.skykit.com/products/dashboards/) if “static public data sharing” is disabled in your Datadog account. Dashboard Connections allows you to share your Datadog dashboards securely on your digital signage displays throughout your operations. If you're interested in purchasing this specialized license, please contact [Skykit sales](mailto:sales@skykit.com) to discuss a private offer.

### Pricing

$30/month per screen (up to 10 screens).

Volume discounts are available for orders over 10 screens. For custom pricing terms, contract length, and companies outside North America, reach out to Skykit at sales@skykit.com.

## Setup

Once you’ve requested your free trial, a Skykit representative will reach out to introduce you to the platform. We will then ship your media player and provide detailed instructions on how to start sharing your Datadog dashboards on your large format displays.
