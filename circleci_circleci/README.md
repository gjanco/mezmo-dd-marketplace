As the largest continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform, CircleCI empowers engineers to seamlessly take ideas to execution, at scale. Every feature of the platform is built to fine-tune the entire development process from start to finish.

CircleCI offers the widest choices for customizing operating systems, CPUs, GPUs, memory, and images for each job. Build for Docker, Windows, Linux, ARM, macOS, or build your own compute with runners, all for free.

Teams can orchestrate complex workflows in the cloud, managed by CircleCI, or with a server plan, self-hosted by you.
