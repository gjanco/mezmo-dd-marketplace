# Steadybit

## Overview

[Steadybit][1] is a chaos engineering platform that allows you to simulate turbulent conditions like network latency or container crashes in a controlled way to improve system reliability and guide your organization to better incident management.

You benefit from an easy-to-use drag and drop user interface that allows you to rebuild past incidents. Simulate a slow network, stressed resources or an unavailable DNS into your system and check how your system reacts to it and whether your observability solution notices these faults.


Using the [Steadybit DataDog integration][2], you get additional status checks that validate your Datadog monitors while running a chaos engineering experiment. The integration also monitors your chaos engineering experiment runs by making its result, start and end time available as Datadog events.

This Marketplace offering is for a [Professional Plan][3] license for one team. If you have different needs, please reach out to us at [office@steadybit.com][4] to discuss a private offer.


## Setup
1. After you have purchased Steadybit, a customer success representative will reach out to you to set up your tenant and guide you through the setup.
2. In the meantime, you can also [sign up][5] for a free Steadybit account.
3. We will upgrade the tenant after your purchase.

Detailed instructions on setting up the integration of Datadog and Steadybit can be found in the [Steadybit Reliability Hub - Datadog extension][6].
