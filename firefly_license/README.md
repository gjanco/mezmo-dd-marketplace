# Firefly

## Overview
Firefly is a cloud asset management solution that helps cloud teams discover their cloud footprint (including AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and Datadog), automatically transform resources to Infrastructure as Code, and detect drifts and policy violations to make sure their cloud is aligned with its desired state.
Firefly helps teams make their Datadog assets immutable, versioned, scalable, and monitored by managing them as code in any Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of their choice.

### Full cloud inventory
Get a fully searchable inventory of all Datadog assets alongside other cloud assets, such as AWS, K8s, GCP, Okta, and more.

### Automatic codification
Using the [Firefly Datadog Integration][2], you can automatically turn single or multiple Datadog assets into code, including Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, and CDK specifications.

### Detect and fix drift
Get real-time notifications of any discrepancy between your Infrastructure as Code and your actual state of cloud, and push a fix directly to your repository as drift occurs.

### Detect and fix policy violations
Use the Firefly unified policy engine to find hazardous misconfigurations or costly underutilizations, and get alerts on policy violations for both custom and premade policies.
