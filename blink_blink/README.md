# BlinkOps Integration

## Overview

[Blink][1] is a low-code/no-code (LNCN) platform that enables automated incident response, cloud-native operations, and security operations workflows. Blink transforms manual tasks into interactive automations backed by the security and reliability of a cloud-native platform. Every script or ticket becomes a fully-managed automation. 

The user interface and [automation library][2] come with 5,000 cloud-native workflows that make it easy to create new automations. Blink helps you achieve better cloud efficiency and more competitive SLA's, with fewer operational bottlenecks.

Visit our [out-of-the-box integration][6], which allows you to:

- Trigger event-based Blink automations using Datadog incidents
- Create and update Datadog incidents automatically from within Blink
- View incidents or events from the Datadog Events Explorer in Blink
- Automatically enrich and remediate Datadog incidents using Blink automations

For more information about Blink, see the [Blink documentation][3].
