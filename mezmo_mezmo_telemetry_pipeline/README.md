# Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline

## Overview

**Sign up for a Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline SaaS license on the Datadog Marketplace.**


Mezmo Telemetry Pipeline enables organizations to take a new approach towards managing telemetry data directly into Datadog

-   Incorporate data from your existing environment where you're collecting telemetry data to Datadog, or from entirely new data streams to capture a diverse range of telemetry data
-   You can use Processors to  [encrypt](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/encrypt-fields-processor),  [filter](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/filter-by-field-processor),  [route](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/route-processor), and automate other transformations of your data to to make sure that it is tailored to your specific needs for storage and analysis on Datadog
-   Send your processed data to destinations like  [Datadog Logs](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/datadog-logs),  [Datadog Metrics](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/datadog-metrics), and  [other platforms](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/set-up-pipeline-destinations)  so you always know that you will have the data you need in the right place at the right time
-   Use  [Pipeline Taps](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/monitor-data-pipelines)  to monitor the flow of data in your Pipeline, and  [sample Pipeline data in real-time](https://docs.mezmo.com/telemetry-pipelines/view-pipeline-data)  to use in constructing new Pipelines
