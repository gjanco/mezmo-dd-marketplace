# Flagsmith

## Overview

[Flagsmith][1] helps you release features with confidence and manages feature flags across web, mobile, and server-side applications. Use the Flagsmith-hosted API, deploy to your own private cloud, or run on-premise.

Flagsmith provides an all-in-one platform for developing, implementing, and managing your feature flags. Whether you are moving off an in-house solution or using toggles for the first time, Flagsmith will provide both power and efficiency.

### Manage Flags across multiple platforms

Flagsmith makes it easy to create and manage feature toggles across web, mobile, and server-side applications. Wrap a section of code with a flag, and then use Flagsmith to manage that feature.

### Powerful Segmenting rules

Manage feature flags by development environment and by user groupâ€”including individual users, a segment of users, or a percentage. This allows you to implement practices like canary deployments.

### Drive A/B and Multivariate Tests

Multivariate flags allow you to use a percentage split across two or more variations for precise A/B/n testing and experimentation.

### Dashboards

View and control Flagsmith flags directly from your existing Datadog dashboards.

### Events

Send flag change events from Flagsmith into your Datadog event stream with the [Datadog Flagsmith integration][2].
